        <p id="firstCard" className="paragraph">
        At its heart, "Born a Crime" chronicles Noah's childhood as a biracial child in a society where interracial relationships were illegal. Born to a black Xhosa mother and a white Swiss father, Noah's existence was literally a crime under apartheid law, highlighting the absurdity and cruelty of racial segregation. His experiences navigating a world that classified him as neither fully black nor white offer profound insights into the complexities of identity formation in a divided society.
